Asset-Format plugin
===========

Install this plugin to force the asset_id to become part of the path to the asset rather than appended to the end with a question mark, so for example:

http://assets1.yourassethost.com/javascripts/prototype.js?1234263214

becomes:

http://assets1.yourassethost.com/javascripts/1234263214/prototype.js

Installation
